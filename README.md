# Digital Bank Based on Solidity Blockchain

This project is based on concept of liquidity mining or yeild farming. Solidty is used to write smart contracts while the front end is made using ReactJS and bootstrap. Following are the other technologies used in the project:
    i) Ethereum blockchain Ganache 
    ii) Truffle development framework
    iii) web3 libraries
    iv) ReactJS
    v) Metamask wallet

## Features or Example

The project examplifies the yeild farming concept. Users can use this project as digital bank by investing real world token in this application to earn interest in completely new tokens (test tokens called DApp Token in this case).

DAI token is mocked to use here which is a real world token backed by ERc20 token standard ( is preditable, has name(), can be transferred compatible with wallet and can be exchanged).

Investors can buy Dapp tokens with DAI token from the UI.

App owner can have 1 million tokens distributed to the app. In addition to approval of token exchange, owner can also issue the reward to investor with tokens (that's how the investor can earn profit)

## Motivation

I worked in this project while learning ethereum blockchain development. It provides overall idea on how blockchain works in real world.
